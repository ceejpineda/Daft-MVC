# Daft MVC Framework

Daft is a lightweight MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework for small projects built using Node.js and Express. It provides a structured way to organize your code, separate concerns, and build scalable applications.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Daft follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern, allowing you to separate your application logic into three distinct components.
- **Routing**: Easily define routes and handle HTTP requests using Express, providing a clean and intuitive way to handle different endpoints.
- **Controllers**: Create controllers to handle the business logic of your application. Controllers interact with models and views to process requests and send responses.
- **Models**: Define models to represent your data and interact with the database. Daft supports various database systems, including MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.
- **Views**: Use templating engines like EJS or Handlebars to render dynamic views and generate HTML responses.
- **Middleware**: Daft leverages Express middleware to handle common tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more.
- **Configuration**: Configure your application settings, database connections, and other environment-specific variables in a dedicated configuration file.
- **Easy to Use**: Daft aims to be beginner-friendly, with a simple and intuitive API that allows you to get started quickly and efficiently.
